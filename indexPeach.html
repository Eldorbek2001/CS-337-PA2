    <p>The peach (Prunus persica) is a deciduous tree native to the
      region of Northwest China between the Tarim Basin and the north slopes
      of the Kunlun Mountains, where it was first domesticated and cultivated.
      [3] It bears edible juicy fruits with
      various characteristics, most called peaches and others
      (the glossy-skinned varieties), nectarines.

      The specific name persica refers to its widespread cultivation in Persia
      (modern-day Iran), from where it was transplanted to Europe. It belongs
      to the genus Prunus, which includes the cherry, apricot, almond,
      and plum, in the rose family. The peach is classified with the almond
      in the subgenus Amygdalus, distinguished from the other subgenera by the
      corrugated seed shell. Due to their close relatedness, the kernel of a
      peach stone tastes remarkably similar to almond, and peach
      stones are often used to make a cheap version of marzipan, known as
      persipan.[4]</p>
