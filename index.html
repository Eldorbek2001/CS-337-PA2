    <p>An apple is an edible fruit produced
       by an apple tree (Malus domestica).
     Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and
    are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus.
    The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor,
   Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown
   for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought
   to North America by European colonists.
   Apples have religious and mythological significance in many
   cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian
    tradition.</p>
